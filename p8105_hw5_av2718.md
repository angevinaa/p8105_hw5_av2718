This problem focuses on the `Homocide-data.csv` that The Washington Post
gathered in 50 large U.S. cities and made available through GitHub. The
raw data comprises 52179, 12observations. The data included the
geographical location of the homicide, whether an arrest was made, and,
in most cases, basic demographic information about each victim. In
total, the dataset contains 12 variables: city, disposition, lat, lon,
reported_date, state, uid, victim_age, victim_first, victim_last,
victim_race, victim_sex. Interestingly, the first and last names of the
victims are included, as well as the location of the homocide (lat and
log).

In the code chuck below, create a `city_state variable`
(e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the
total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those
for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No
arrest”).

``` r

#Clean and arrange variables

homocide_clean = homocide_raw %>% 
  mutate(.data = ., city_state = str_c(city, ", " ,state)) %>% 
  select(-city, -state) %>% 
  mutate(
    disposition = if_else(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), "unsolved_homicides", "homicides") 
  )

# Summarize by city_sate

homicide_cities = homocide_clean %>% 
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n())  
```
